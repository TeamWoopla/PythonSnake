# PythonSnake
We started experiencing with the Python language and we wanted to test our knowledge by making a quick game, and we thought to ourselves, what game was a good practice both to our language knowledge and to our logic knowledge and we remembered the snake game we made in java. The game isn't fully done, there is a lot more we could have added but we kept it simple. As always, if you want to tinker around with the code the link is down below. Enjoy.
if you wnat to play the game you have to have python 3 installed.
